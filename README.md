# ARBITER (ST21)

A multi-agent AI governance demo. A React SPA talks to a Lambda API that
orchestrates four Bedrock AgentCore Runtimes (1 master + 3 specialists),
backed by a Bedrock Knowledge Base, OpenSearch Serverless vector store, and
a Guardrail. Provisions into a single AWS account via CloudFormation/SAM.

> ⚠️ **Demo project.** Single-AZ, AttachWaf=false, shared demo password
